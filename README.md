# Customer Churn Prediction - Telecom Dataset

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze customer data from a telecommunications company to predict customer churn â€” the likelihood that a customer will discontinue their service. By understanding which factors contribute to churn, the company can develop targeted strategies to improve customer retention and customer satisfaction.
